## 🎨 Approach

This case study demonstrates:

1. **Systems Thinking** - Understanding how Krista fits in the broader automation/AI ecosystem
2. **Customer-Centricity** - Grounding decisions in user pain points and business outcomes
3. **Technical Fluency** - Realistic assessment of engineering effort and dependencies
4. **Strategic Prioritization** - RICE framework applied to feature decisions
5. **Clear Communication** - Structured, visual, and actionable recommendations

## 🚀 Quick Start

To review the full case study:

1. Start with `executive-summary.md` for the TL;DR
2. Review `product-analysis/` for my understanding of Krista
3. Dive into `roadmap/` for detailed phased initiatives
4. Check `technical-considerations/` for engineering perspective

## 🔑 Key Highlights

- **Primary Focus:** Platform usability, integration ecosystem, and AI agent orchestration
- **Differentiation Strategy:** "No-code AI orchestration" positioning
- **North Star Metric:** Time-to-automation for business users
- **Resource Philosophy:** 70% feature development, 20% tech debt, 10% innovation

## 📊 Visual Roadmap

See `roadmap/visual-roadmap.png` for a Gantt-style timeline of initiatives (would be created with actual design tools in production).

## 💡 Rationale

Each decision in this roadmap is tied to:
- **Business Impact** - Revenue, retention, or market positioning
- **Customer Value** - Solving real pain points with measurable outcomes
- **Technical Feasibility** - Realistic scope given team constraints
- **Strategic Alignment** - Building toward long-term platform vision
