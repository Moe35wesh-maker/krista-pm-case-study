## üîÑ Metric Evolution

Metrics should evolve as the product matures:

**Early Stage (Now - Month 6):**
- Focus: Activation and retention
- Key Metrics: Time-to-first-automation, activation rate, D7/D30 retention

**Growth Stage (Month 6-12):**
- Focus: Scaling usage and expansion
- Key Metrics: MAU growth, feature adoption, NRR, ARPA

**Maturity Stage (Month 12-24):**
- Focus: Efficiency and ecosystem
- Key Metrics: CAC payback, LTV/CAC, marketplace GMV, partner-sourced revenue

---

**Bottom Line:**  
Success metrics should be few, measurable, and directly tied to business value. The North Star (time-to-first-automation) keeps the team aligned, while supporting metrics provide a comprehensive health check. Regular reviews ensure we're moving the needle on what matters most.
