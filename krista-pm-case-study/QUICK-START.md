## üí° How to Use This for Interviews

### For PM Interviews

**Prepare to Discuss:**
1. "Walk me through your prioritization process for the 0-6 month roadmap"
2. "Why did you choose AI agent orchestration as the strategic bet?"
3. "How would you validate these assumptions with customers?"
4. "What if engineering said the Agent Hub would take 2x longer?"
5. "How do you balance technical debt vs. new features?"

**Be Ready to Defend:**
- Why template marketplace before developer platform?
- Why these metrics vs. others?
- How did you estimate engineering effort?
- What research validated these priorities?

### For Leadership Discussions

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
> "I developed a 24-month product roadmap for Krista's AI automation platform. Phase 1 focuses on reducing time-to-value through onboarding and templates. Phase 2 establishes category leadership in AI agent orchestration. Phase 3 builds platform moat through partner ecosystem and industry solutions. The roadmap balances quick wins with strategic differentiation while respecting team constraints."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Customer pain points drove prioritization
- RICE framework for objective decision-making  
- Realistic given 4-engineer team
- Tied to business outcomes ($14M+ incremental ARR)
- Builds competitive moat through network effects

## üìä Key Numbers to Remember

### Resource Allocation
- **70%** feature development
- **20%** technical debt
- **10%** innovation/experimentation

### Roadmap Phases
- **0-6M:** Foundation (reduce friction)
- **6-12M:** Differentiation (AI agents)
- **12-24M:** Ecosystem (platform play)

### Business Impact
- **Phase 1:** $1.2M+ ARR impact
- **Phase 2:** $3.6M+ ARR impact  
- **Phase 3:** $14M+ ARR impact
- **Total 24M:** $10M ‚Üí $30M ARR (3x growth)

### Team Growth
- **M0:** 4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM
- **M12:** 6 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM
- **M24:** 10 engineers, 2 designers, 2 PMs

## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not start with industry solutions if they have higher ASP?**  
A: Foundation must come first. Without good onboarding and templates, industry solutions won't stick. Sequencing: adoption ‚Üí retention ‚Üí monetization.

**Q: How confident are you in the RICE scores?**  
A: Scores are directional, not absolute. Confidence ranges 70-90% based on available data. Would validate through customer interviews, prototypes, and beta programs before committing to build.

**Q: What if a competitor launches agent orchestration first?**  
A: Being first matters less than being best. Would accelerate timeline, leverage our differentiation (no-code, conversational), and emphasize template marketplace as switching cost.

**Q: Why only 4 engineers for 2 years?**  
A: Constraint = forcing function for focus. Shows ability to prioritize ruthlessly. Realistically would advocate for team growth, but wanted to demonstrate working within constraints.

**Q: How do you handle requests that don't make the roadmap?**  
A: Transparent communication with stakeholders about trade-offs. Document in backlog with RICE score. Offer workarounds or alternatives. Commit to revisiting quarterly.
