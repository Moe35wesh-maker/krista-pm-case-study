# Roadmap: 6-12 Months (Differentiation & Scale)

## 🎯 Phase Objective

**Establish category leadership in AI agent orchestration while building platform network effects through community and ecosystem.**

**Theme:** "The AI Orchestration Operating System"

**Core Hypothesis:** The market is fragmenting into isolated AI agents (Copilot, Agentforce, etc.). Krista can win by becoming the orchestration layer that manages and coordinates ALL AI agents across the enterprise, creating a new category we own.

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (M6) | Target (M12) | Measurement |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Multi-Agent Deployments | 0 | 200+ customers | Product usage |
| Template Marketplace GMV | $0 | $250K | Revenue tracking |
| Community Contributors | 0 | 100+ | Platform data |
| Analytics Adoption | 0% | 40% | Feature adoption |
| Enterprise Deal Size | Baseline | +35% | Sales data |
| Net Revenue Retention | 110% | 125% | Finance data |

## 🗓️ Month-by-Month Breakdown

### Month 7-9: AI Agent Orchestration

#### Initiative 1: AI Agent Orchestration Hub (P0)
**Problem:** Enterprises are deploying multiple AI agents (ChatGPT, Copilot, Agentforce, custom models) without coordination, leading to chaos, duplicate work, and governance gaps.

**Solution:**  
A centralized command center to deploy, monitor, coordinate, and govern all AI agents across the enterprise.

**Key Capabilities:**

**Agent Registry & Discovery**
- Catalog of all AI agents in use across organization
- Agent capabilities taxonomy (document processing, code generation, customer support, etc.)
- Agent metadata: owner, cost, performance, integrations
- "Find the right agent for your task" intelligent matching

**Agent Orchestration Engine**
- Multi-agent workflows: chain agents together for complex processes
- Intelligent routing: send tasks to the optimal agent
- Fallback logic: if Agent A fails, try Agent B
- Human-in-the-loop escalation paths
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols

**Governance & Control**
- Role-based access control (who can use which agents)
- Usage quotas and cost controls
- PII/sensitive data protection rules
- Audit logs for compliance
- Agent approval workflows (prevent shadow AI)

**Monitoring & Analytics**
- Real-time agent status dashboard
- Performance metrics: accuracy, response time, cost per query
- Usage patterns and trending agents
- Anomaly detection (unusual behavior or costs)
- SLA monitoring and alerting

**Agent Marketplace Integration**
- Pre-configured agents for common tasks
- One-click deployment from marketplace
- Agent templates (configure your own agent)
- Third-party agent integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

**User Story:**
> "As a CTO, I want a single pane of glass to see all AI agents in use, enforce governance policies, and ensure agents work together seamlessly, so we can realize AI's potential without chaos or risk."

**Technical Architecture:**
- Agent abstraction layer (unified API for any LLM)
- Event-driven orchestration engine
- Policy engine for governance rules
- Real-time metrics collection and dashboarding

**Scope:**
- Support for 10+ AI agent types initially (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, custom models)
- Orchestration workflows with 5+ agents
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- Basic governance policies (RBAC, quotas, audit logs)

**Engineering Effort:** 2 BE + 1 FE × 10 weeks = 30 engineer-weeks  
**Design Effort:** 1 designer × 4 weeks = 4 design-weeks

**Dependencies:**
- API partnerships with major LLM providers
- Security review for multi-tenant agent execution
- Legal review for agent governance features

**Success Criteria:**
- 50% of new customers deploy Agent Hub within 90 days
