# Roadmap: 0-6 Months (Foundation & Velocity)

## 🎯 Phase Objective

**Reduce time-to-value and accelerate self-serve adoption by eliminating friction in the user journey.**

**Theme:** "From Hours to Minutes"

**Core Hypothesis:** Most prospective customers abandon Krista during onboarding because they can't quickly see how it solves their specific problem. By providing guided experiences and pre-built solutions, we can 2x activation rates.

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Time-to-First-Automation | 4-8 hours | <2 hours | Product analytics |
| Onboarding Completion Rate | 35% | 70% | Activation funnel |
| Template Usage Rate | 20% | 80% | Feature adoption |
| Support Tickets (Integration) | 45/week | <25/week | Support dashboard |
| Self-Serve Adoption | 30% | 60% | Sales data |
